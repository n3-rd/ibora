## Tech

Ohun uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [HowlerJS](https://github.com/goldfire/howler.js) - [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) is an audio library for the modern web. It defaults to [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) and falls back to [HTML5 Audio](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-audio-element). This makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable across all platforms.
- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) - Build an optimized, secure, and frontend-independent application for multi-platform deployment.
- [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) web development, streamlined
- [Shadcn-Svelte](https://shadcn-svelte.com/) - Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

And of course Ibora itself is open source with a [repository](https://github.com/n3-rd/ibora) on GitHub.
